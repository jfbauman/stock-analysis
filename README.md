# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
### The purpose of this analysis is to help my friend Steve guide his parents in their investing journey. Steve's parents invested all of their money in DAQO, a green energy stock because that's what they are passionate about, but they didn't do any research on this corporation. We want to help Steve by showing him if his parents made a good choice or if it may be better for them to diversify thier funds. 

## Results
### The analysis of the stock data for DAQO, and other green energy companies, did not show great results. In 2017, DAQO had a return of 8.9%, but in 2018 they had a 7.3% loss. Overall, most of the energy companies showed returns on 2017, contrary to 2018 where most energy stocks showed negative returns.
